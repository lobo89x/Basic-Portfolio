        Born underweight and 2 and ahalf months early, Alexander has come along way. After earning his Bacheleors of Science in Physics, he went to work for a small tech company where he learned he had a knack for learning many tools at once. After a few years he realized he wanted to make the tools not just learn them. He took a few detours but is now at the latest chapter of his journey and is still learning all he can.
